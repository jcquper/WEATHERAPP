I struggled a lot with this project and had a lot of tough spots I really struggle a lot with Javascript functions and building something more functional I feel more confident when I can just design or build front end things but understand I need to challenge myself if I want to get better at this kind of stuff. Previously I recieved a lot of good advice from graders so I would love some suggestions because this was probably the hardest assignment for me.
